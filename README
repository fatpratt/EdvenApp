This repo contains two separate projects in one: the EdVentureMaze Android App and
the EdVentureMaze Applet.  Since most of the code can be shared between the two 
platforms, the code base is consolidated into this one repository.

Code common to both projects (aka "maze core" code) resides in the following 
packages:
	com.edventuremaze.maze
	com.edventuremaze.utils
	
Platform specific code should never go into the above directories.  Platform 
specific code should be abstracted out using the factory pattern illustrated 
numerous times in this code base.  Keeping the maze code clean and consolidated 
will be critical for maintaining code in the future.
	
Code specific to the Java Applet resides in the following package:
	com.edventuremaze.applet
	com.edventuremaze.applet.maze
	com.edventuremaze.applet.utils

Code specific to the Android App resides in the following files, packages and 
folders: 
	com.edventuremaze.and
	com.edventuremaze.and.maze
	com.edventuremaze.and.utils
	res
	AndroidManifest.xml
	
It might be handy to have two separate IDE projects for each of the overlapping 
code bases: one for the Android App and one for the Java Applet.  When switching
between the two projects, you might have to make adjustments (comment out some
code and comment in other code) to each file in the following package:
	com.edventuremaze.factories
	
Perhaps in the future another platform will make use of the common routines here,  
too.  For example, perhaps a GWT version of this code will produce a build suitable
for running HTML 5 canvas version of EdVentureMaze.
